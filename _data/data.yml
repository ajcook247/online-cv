      - role: Graduate Research Assistant
        time: 2023 - 2024
        company: University of Tennessee, Knoxville
        details: |
          I worked under Dr. Mongi Abidi at the IRIS Lab at UTK to update and improve
          a GUI application develop in Python. This application is an analytical tool
          the reported object detection results for various machine learning model for
          images under visual augmentations (i.e. blur, noise, distortions, etc.) and also
          automated generation of augmented image datasets. I integrated newer ML architectures
          into the pipeline and compared detection findings between these new models and
          previous existing ones. From there, I analyzed and catalogued the profieiency of these
          models under image augmentation. My work with Dr. Abidi extended to a research project titled
          "Fast Augmentation of Datasets using Augmentation" (see Projects).
      - role: Mechanical Designer
        time: 2017 - 2017
        company: GP Instruments
        details: |
          I worked part-time at GP Instruments as a mechanical designer, using Alibre Design
          to create drawings and various components for a pharmaceutical autosampler. These
          drawings were transformed into proper schematics for later use. I also worked with a 
          small team to design a mouthguard-like product that would be used to analytically treat
          a swallowing disorder called dysphagia. We employed 3D printing, laser-cutting, and
          stereolithography during designing and prototyping.
